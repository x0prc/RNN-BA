## üåê Reccurent Neural Network for BioAuth

This repository is based on my understanding and implementation of the algorithms published in Paper : <br>
`Ackerson, Joseph M., Rushit Dave, and Naeem Seliya. 2021. "Applications of Recurrent Neural Network for Biometric Authentication & Anomaly Detection" Information 12, no. 7: 272. https://doi.org/10.3390/info12070272`


## üî® Background
<details>
<summary>Introduction Section</summary><br>
<p>1. A few examples of
biometric authentication are mouse movement authentication, keystroke authentication,
handwritten password authentication, and even palm print authentication. Moving
away from sensor-based biometric authentication makes it available to numerous different
uses that previously required a specific sensor. Not only will this allow for more accessible
biometric authentication, but it will keep the system and devices more secure as these types
of biometrics are much harder to impersonate. RNNs can also open the environments in
which authentication is performed.</p>

<p>2. Facial recognition ranges from identifying one‚Äôs identity to deciphering their
emotions. Expression recognition often relies on a CNN for extraction of important features
from image data before that image data can be used by the RNN [6]. Once these features are
deciphered the LSTM RNN can make a prediction about the emotion perceived</p>

<p>3. One popular implementation of RNNs is applied to the domain of anomaly detection.
Anomaly detection can range from detecting spam emails, to malicious network traffic
and maritime vessel traffic</p>

<p>4. One such application of anomaly detection can be applied to Internet of
Things (IoT) devices. An example of Anomaly Detection in IoT devices can be seen in where researchers develop an Intrusion Detection System
(IDS) for IoT devices. An IDS using a RNN would rely on detecting anomalous patterns in
the data to alert a user if there was anyone trying to hack into their IoT devices.</p>
  
These are the four main topics that this paper will be reviewing. The goal of this paper
is to analyze novel approaches in each of the four applications of RNNs.
